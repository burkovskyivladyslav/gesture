# Roadmap

This package is under **active development**, as it still **misses** some **features**.

As I think it is still more than **usable** in its current **state**, I'm **releasing** it.

- ✔️ : Done
- 👨‍💻 : WIP
- ❓ : Ideas

The **roadmap** includes:

- 👨‍💻 **Finishing documenting the whole API**
- 👨‍💻 **Decent test suite**
- 👨‍💻 **Better demos and examples**
- ❓ **Swipe support (already achievable with [Drag](/use-drag))**
