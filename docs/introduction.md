# Getting Started

**vueuse/gesture** is a set of **Vue Composables** that aims at helping you making your **Vue** apps **interactive** through **pointer** and **touch** gesture support.

It is a port of the **best** gesture support package **from** the **React** ecosystem, [**react-use-gesture**](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-use-gesture) by [**Poimandres**](https://github.com/pmndrs).

It includes an **additional layer** providing Vue support using both **composable functions** or **directives**.

If you use this package and **encounter** any **problem**, please submit an **issue** on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/vueuse/motion).

If you **liked** this package, please **follow** me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/yaeeelglx).
