# Wheel

Use your mouse wheel or trackpad.

Both axis and velocity are supported.

<WheelExample />

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Directive usage -->
  <div ref="demo" v-wheel="wheelHandler" />
</template>

<script setup>
const demo = ref()

// Find more about `set()` on the "Motion Integration" page

const wheelHandler = ({ movement: [x, y], wheeling }) => {
  if (!wheeling) {
    set({
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
    })

    return
  }

  set({
    y,
    x,
  })
}

// Composable usage
useWheel(wheelHandler, {
  domTarget: demo,
})
</script>
```

## Specificities

Mouse devices such as the Macbook trackpad, or the Magic Mouse have inertia

There is no native way to distinguish between an actual wheel intent and its resulting inertia.

To detect intent, you can use [**Lethargy**](https://github.com/d4nyll/lethargy).
